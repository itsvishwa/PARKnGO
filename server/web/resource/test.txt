resource files for web app

The "resources/" directory is often used for storing non-public assets or resource files that are needed by your web application but are not directly accessible to users via the web browser.
These resource files can include configuration templates, language localization files, server-side scripts, or any other files that are used internally by the application.
Unlike the "public/" directory, the contents of the "resources/" directory are typically not served directly by the web server to external users. Instead, they are accessed programmatically by the server-side code.
